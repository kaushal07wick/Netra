# Information Stream for Self-Driving Car with YOLOv8 Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition

## Overview

This repository provides an Information Stream solution for self-driving cars, specifically focusing on Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8). YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its speed and accuracy.

## Features

- Real-time Traffic Sign Detection: Utilizing the power of YOLOv8, our system can detect traffic signs in real-time, enabling quick and accurate decision-making for self-driving cars.
  
- Robust Recognition: The model is trained on a diverse dataset to ensure robust recognition of various traffic sign types, shapes, and sizes.

- Streamlined Information Output: The system provides a seamless information stream, allowing easy integration with self-driving car systems.

- Customizable: Easily adapt the system to different environments and requirements by fine-tuning the YOLOv8 model or adjusting the configuration parameters.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and follow the installation instructions in the provided documentation.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Netra.git
    ```
  and open the jupyter notebook after creating a virtual environment from the requirements.txt file.

2. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your own dataset or use a pre-existing one for training the model. Ensure that it covers a wide range of traffic sign scenarios.

3. **Model Training**: Train the YOLOv8 model on your dataset using the provided command on the Notebook. Tweak the configuration to achieve optimal performance.



4. **Inference**: Run the trained model on live video streams or pre-recorded videos to detect and recognize traffic signs.


## Usage

There is a Jupyter Notebook present, kindly use that for the experimentation.
[Roboflow](https://public.roboflow.com/) account is need to be set for using the datasets for training.
